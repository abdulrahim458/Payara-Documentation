= Cloud Connectors

The Payara Cloud Connectors are a collection of JCA adapters for use with various popular cloud messaging providers. These connectors can be deployed to either Payara Server or Payara Micro.

The following connectors are available:

* xref:Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Apache Kafka.adoc[Apache Kafka]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Amazon SQS/Overview.adoc[Amazon SQS]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/MQTT.adoc[MQTT]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Azure SB.adoc[Azure Service Bus]

[[obtaining-connectors]]
== Obtaining the connectors

Cloud Connectors can be built from source as follows:

Clone the https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors[Cloud-Connectors] git repository:

[source, shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:payara/Cloud-Connectors.git
----

Checkout the 0.8.0 tag:

[source, shell]
----
cd Cloud-Connectors/
git checkout tags/0.8.0 -b 0.8.0
----

Build and install the connectors:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

The connectors can be found in the following locations as JCA RARs:

* Kafka -  ./Kafka/KafkaRAR/target/kafka-rar-0.8.0.rar
* Amazon SQS - ./AmazonSQS/AmazonSQSRAR/target/amazon-sqs-rar-2.1.0.rar
* MQTT - ./MQTT/MQTTRAR/target/mqtt-rar-0.8.0.rar
* Azure Service Bus - ./AzureServiceBus/AzureSBRAR/target/azure-sb-rar-0.8.0.rar

[[installing-a-connector]]
== Installing a connector

Installing Cloud Connectors for Payara Server and Payara Micro both require the Cloud Connector jar to be deployed. However, Payara Server requires some additional configuration to classloading.

A connector (JCA rar) is installed by deploying it in the same way as an application archive (e.g. a .war) is deployed:

[[install-connector-server]]
=== Payara Server

You can configure Payara Server through the Admin Console or through the Asadmin CLI.

[[install-connector-server-admin-console]]
==== Using the Admin Console

You can deploy the connector with the admin console;

image:cloud-connectors/admin-console.png[Admin Console]

Then configure the `Connector Classloading Policy` to `Global` in `{config} > Connector Service > Connector Classloading Policy`.

image:cloud-connectors/classloading-configuration.png[Classloading Config]

This allows the classes from the cloud connector to be globally available in the server.

[[install-connector-server-asadmin]]
==== Using the Asadmin CLI

Deploy the application with the CLI;

----
asadmin> deploy --target=server amazon-sqs-rar-2.1.0.rar
----

Configure the classloading policy;

----
asadmin> set configs.config.server-config.connector-service.class-loading-policy=global
----

[[install-connector-micro]]
=== Payara Micro

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --deploy kafka-rar-0.8.0.rar
----

The connector is subsequently available to all other applications deployed to Payara Micro. An application using a connector and the connector itself can be deployed simultaneously:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --deploy kafka-rar-0.8.0.rar --deploy myapp.war
----

[[securing-credentials]]
== Securing credentials

In the documentation pages for the currently available cloud connectors, much of the configuration shown is done via annotations. This configuration
contains credentials as well, which as a rule of thumb should not directly be placed in code. On Payara all properties can be replaced via System properties using the syntax ${system.property.name} or environment variables using the syntax `${ENV=evironment.property.name}` or password aliases using the syntax `${ALIAS=alias.name}`.
