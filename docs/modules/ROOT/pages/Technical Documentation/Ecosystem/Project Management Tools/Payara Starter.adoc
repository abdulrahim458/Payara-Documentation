== Generating a New App using Payara Starter

You can generate a new application using Payara Starter in two ways:

[[commandline-archetype]]
=== Command Line Using Archetype

To generate a new application using the Payara Starter archetype from the command line, use the following Maven command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=fish.payara.starter -DarchetypeArtifactId=payara-starter-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-beta4 <other options>
----
This command generates a new application based on specified options. Adjust properties according to your project requirements.

=== Web application at `start.payara.fish`

Visit https://start.payara.fish[start.payara.fish] to use the web application for generating applications via a graphical interface.

[[using-the-payara-starter-web-application]]
==== Using the Payara Starter Web Application

Payara Starter provides a convenient web application that allows you to generate Jakarta EE projects via a graphical interface.

Follow these steps to use the web application:

. Access the web application:
* Visit the Payara Starter web application at https://start.payara.fish[https://start.payara.fish].

. Fill in the *Project Details*:
* On the web application's landing page, you'll find a user-friendly interface to input project details.
* Enter the required information, such as *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, and other relevant details.
+
You can customize these based on your project requirements:
+
image::payara-starter/project-details.png[Project Details]

. Choose the *Build System* and *Jakarta EE Version*:
* Select your preferred build system (Maven or Gradle) from the provided options.
* Choose the desired Jakarta EE version that aligns with your project's compatibility requirements.
+
image::payara-starter/jakartaee.png[Jakarta EE version]

. Configure any *Additional Options*:
* The web application allows you to configure additional options such as MicroProfile integration, Payara Platform version, and more.
* Customize these options based on your project needs.
+
image::payara-starter/payara-platform.png[Payara Platform]

. Review and Generate:
* Review the summary of your selected options to ensure they match your project requirements.
* Click the *Generate* button to initiate the project generation process.

. Download the Generated Project:
* Once the generation process is complete, the web application triggers the download of the generated project archive.
* Download the project archive, and you can then proceed to import it into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

NOTE: The web application simplifies the project creation process but may not expose all configuration options available through the command-line archetype generation. +
If you need better control of how the application is generated, we recommend using the starter archetype instead.

[[sample-generated-jakarta-rest]]
== Sample Generated Jakarta REST Resource

Here's an example of a generated Jakarta REST resource using Payara Starter:

[source,java]
----
package fish.payara.hello;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    public Response hello(@QueryParam("name") String name) {
        if ((name == null) || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            name = "world";
        }
        return Response.ok(name).build();
    }
}
----

This sample demonstrates a simple REST endpoint named `hello` that accepts a query parameter `name` and responds with a greeting message.

Feel free to adjust archetype parameters to tailor the generated application to your project requirements.
