= Amazon SQS Versioning

The SQS connector's behavior and features are affected by the exact version of the Amazon Web Services Java SDK version being planned to use. For each version, there are separate versions of the connector's JCA adapter and its API.

The tags below are for the https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors[Cloud Connectors repository]. You should use the one corresponding to the SQS and Jakarta version you require.

https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors/releases/tag/0.8.0[0.8.0]:: Amazon SQS Version 1 using JakartaEE 8 and the `javax` namespace
https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors/releases/tag/AmazonSQS-1.1.0[AmazonSQS-1.1.0]:: Amazon SQS Version 2 using JakartaEE 8 and the `javax` namespace
https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors/releases/tag/AmazonSQS-2.1.0[AmazonSQS-2.1.0]:: Amazon SQS Version 2 using JakartaEE 10 and the `jakarta` namespace

[[amazon-sqs-connector-version-1]]
== Amazon SQS Connector Version 1

This is the first version of the connector that is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html[Amazon Web Services Java SDK v1].

[[v1-usage]]
=== Usage

The `amazon-sqs-rar-0.8.0.rar` JCA adapter has to be deployed as shown in the xref:/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Overview.adoc#Installing-a-connector[Installing a connector section] of the Cloud Connectors overview.

Additionally, to use the connector API add the following Maven dependencies to your application's project:

  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud.connectors.amazonsqs</groupId>
  <artifactId>amazon-sqs-jca-api</artifactId>
