Full, up-to-date build instructions for the NetBeans IDE can be read on the https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master#apache-netbeans[README file in the NetBeans repository]

You must first clone the repository where the plugin source code is stored. https://github.com/apache/netbeans[NetBeans Code Repository]

Install Apache Ant::
Apache Ant is the build tool for the Payara Tools NetBeans IDE Plugin and must be configured locally. https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html[Install Apache Ant]

JDK 11::
JDK 11 is required to build and run Apache NetBeans

IMPORTANT: If you are building NetBeans on Windows. `Program Files` must be replaced with `PROGRA~1` and `Program Files (x86)` must be replaced with `PROGRA~2` in your `ANT_HOME` environment variable.

== Payara Tools Code

The Payara Tools plugin code is split into five modules, these are all located under the `enterprise` directory:

* https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/payara.common[payara.common]
* https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/payara.eecommon[payara.eecommon]
* https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/payara.jakartaee[payara.jakartaee]
* https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/payara.micro[payara.micro]
* https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/payara.tooling[payara.tooling]

To test any code changes, recompile the modified module, then rerun the IDE build using `ant tryme`.
