This run configuration will be configured by default to deploy the project you are currently working on. If you wish to modify which application is deployed, edit the `Working Directory` option. Otherwise the default settings are correct, and click *OK*.

IMPORTANT: Due to a known issue within the IntelliJ IDEA Payara plugin, you must modify the default `Run` option by removing the leading and trailing quotation marks, `"`.
